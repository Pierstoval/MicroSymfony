# MicroSymfony üé∂

MicroSymfony is a template to initialize an application to use Symfony as a micro-framework.

It can be used to create a POC or prototype something without having to take care
of the design while having something still enjoyable (and fit to be seen).

Even if it is minimalist, the quality isn't sacrificed.
There are tests (100% coverage) and CS checks: php-cs-fixer+PHPStan.
All this is checked with a GitHub actions workflow.

It's not really intended to be used in production, use a your own risks.
Well, at least you should remove the classless framework to use a modern CSS framework.

If you like it, don't forget to add a [‚ú®](https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony)
please.

PR are of course welcome if you think something can be fixed or improved. 


## Demo üåà

Because a live demo is always better than all explanations. Here is it:

* Live demo at [https://microsymfony.ovh](https://microsymfony.ovh)


## Todo üñã 


## To try/test üí°

* try dropin minimal: https://github.com/dohliam/dropin-minimal-css


## Requirements ‚öô

* [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php)
* The [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)
* The [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) PHP extension if you want to run the code coverage report


## Stack üîó

* [Symfony 6.3](https://symfony.com)
* [Twig 3](https://twig.symfony.com)
* [Stimulus 3.2](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)
* [PHPUnit 9.5](https://phpunit.de)
* The classless [BareCSS](http://barecss.com) CSS framework 


## Barecss forks üé®

* https://github.com/zonradkuse


## What does it ship? üöÄ

* A [demo with some JavaScript and Stimulus using the new Sf 6.3 asset mapper component](https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony/blob/main/templates/stimulus.html.twig) 
* A [default error page extending the base layout](https://github.com/strangebuzz/symfony-micro/blob/main/templates/bundles/TwigBundle/Exception/error.html.twig)


## What it doesn't ship? ‚ùå

* The debug toolbar
* Doctrine


## Installation & first run üöÄ

    composer install

Start the web server:

    make start

Or with [Castor](https://github.com/jolicode/castor):

    castor symfony:start


Then open [https://127.0.0.1:8000](https://127.0.0.1:8000)

The port can change if `8000` is already used.


## Tests ‚úÖ

Run tests with:

    vendor/bin/simple-phpunit

Using composer:

    composer app:test

Using the Makefile:

    make test

Using the [Castor](https://github.com/jolicode/castor):

    castor test:all

Make your choice! ‚úÖ 


## Code coverage ‚ôªÔ∏è

The code coverage is at 100% and is analysed with a simple script 
(thanks [Ocramius](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/automated-code-coverage-check-for-github-pull-requests-with-travis/)).

For instance, in the following build, the code coverage analysis fails because the
code coverage is 95.35% which is the below the wanted threshold of 100%.

    https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony/actions/runs/5220428064/jobs/9423476258

The default threshold is 100%, you can change it in the [GitHub actions file](.github/workflows/symfony.yml). 

When the step runs, it fails if the current coverage is below the wanted threshold.
As simple as this.

To have the complete HTML report (xdebug must be activated), run:

    make coverage

Or

    castor test:coverage

Then open the report in your browser:

    make cov-report

Or

    castor test:cov-report


## Dev-tools ‚ú®
 
* php-cs-fixer with the [Symfony ruleset and PHP strict types](https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony/blob/main/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php)
* PHPStan at [maximum level](https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony/blob/main/phpstan.neon)
* [Castor task runner](https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony/blob/main/castor.php)
* A simple [Makefile](https://github.com/strangebuzz/MicroSymfony/blob/main/Makefile)
